summary: In England, expenditure among e‐cigarette and nicotine replacement therapy users is approximately one‐third of the expenditure of smokers. The average smoker may save an estimated £15.06 per week by switching completely to e‐cigarettes or £13.04 per week by switching to nicotine replacement therapy, although this is likely to differ according to individual usage patterns.
