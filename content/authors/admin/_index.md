I am a researcher in Epidemiology and Behavioural Science, working within the University College London Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group (UTARG). My research as part of the SPECTRUM research consortium involve two key objectives:

1) To expand an existing informative data source in England – the Smoking and Alcohol Toolkit Study (www.smokinginengland.info and www.alcoholinengland.info) – to other nations in Great Britain using new participatory methods to refine data collection in response to evolving policymaker needs and public interest; and 

2) To develop and apply new methods from applied statistics and economics for integrating data and forecasting new trends, and build towards a microsimulation model of smoking and quitting in Great Britain to identify emergent effects from divergent policy scenarios.
